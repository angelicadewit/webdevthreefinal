						From coding for fun to a career choice
					</h2>
					<p>
						My first experience with coding began back in 2003 with Yahoo's Geocities drag and drop style of "coding". Eventually, I became frustrated so I began learning HTML and CSS using Windows FrontPage. I felt so cool when I started using the editor part rather than the visual editor. This was back when I was learning DIV layouts and colored sidebars to match my anchor tags.
					</p>
					<p>
						I managed three different websites at the time: a personal one, a blend challenge site and online trading card collection. I learned the syntax for Livejournal, MySpace, and Xanga. I remember one of my biggest goals was to learn PHP since thats were the trend seem to be heading towards and to be hosted by someone before I owned a domain and server.
					</p>
					<p>
						Eventually, school and other interests sort took over. I still coded my tumblr site, changing layouts to the font sizes and images to what I liked. To be honest, I still have yet to code out a tumblr layout from start to finish.
					</p>
					<h2>
						The Final Decision
					</h2>
					<p>
						I studied journalism while in college but didn't feel like it was the right path for me. I sort of hopped around from one idea of a career to another while I was living in Louisiana, working a simple office job. I still wanted to write but the idea of writing for a newspaper or magazine didn't interest me.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was an AskReddit that lead me to Creative Circus, as well as a fan of AMC's Mad Men at the time. I had originally wanted to sign up for the copywriting program since I thought it was a way that I can still write as a career. I came across the Interactive Dev program and realized that I was more excited about this curriculum than copywriting's.
					</p>
					<p>
						It then clicked for me. I've always liked coding as a hobby and decided to take the leap to make it into a career. Funny enough, in a way, I still found a career where I get to write. Everything manages to find a way.
